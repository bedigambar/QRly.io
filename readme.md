## 💻 How It Works

QRly.io uses the free QR Code API from [QR Server](https://goqr.me/api/) to generate QR codes based on user input. When you click the "Generate QR Code" button, your text or URL is sent to the API, which returns a QR code image. You can then download this image with a single click.

```javascript
// Core generation function
function generateQR() {
    if (qrText.value.length > 0) {
        qrImg.src = "https://api.qrserver.com/v1/create-qr-code/?size=150x150&data=" + encodeURIComponent(qrText.value);
        imageBox.classList.add("show-img");
        downloadBtn.style.display = "block";
    }
}
```
